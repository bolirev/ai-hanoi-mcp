    "# Solving Hanoi Tower with AI\n",

    "The read of the illusion of thinking (from Apple's research) found reasonance in my own fun in problem solving. At a certain problem complexity, I give up when not equipped with the right tools. Perhaps then my problem solving is not much about thinking about the problem, but thinking about the tools to solve the problem. So it lead me to this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does non thinking AI solves puzzle better than thinking one when provided with the right tools?\n",
    "- Does thinking AI are able to pick up the right tools to solve it?\n",

    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we'll:\n",
    "1. Set up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for puzzle validation\n",
    "2. Configure an AI agent to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle\n",
    "3. Compare different approaches (with/without MCP, with/without pseudocode)\n",
    "4. Analyze the agent's problem-solving strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi serves as an excellent test case because:\n",
    "- It has a clear, well-defined solution\n",
    "- It requires systematic thinking and planning\n",
    "- It can be validated step-by-step\n",
    "- It demonstrates both recursive and iterative approaches"
